Projects for measuring complexities of basic programming algorithms.

Hello.

As a project for my university studies, I made 5 C++ programmes to measure complexities of 5 basic programming algorithms, that is: Linear/Sequential Search, Binary Search, Bubble Sort,
Quick Sort and Linear Search.
Their complexities are defined in two ways: a number of comparisons between two values and time (milliseconds) it takes to finish an iteration of algorithm.
Each of them are printed into .txt file next to a size of (randomly filled) integers array the algorithm was executed on, so each row looks like this: size/comparisons/time.
This data are ready for generating graphs in MS Excel or Open Office Calc etc.

Number of iterations for each array and size for the largest array can be switchted in Test[...]() function.

Hope you find it useful.
